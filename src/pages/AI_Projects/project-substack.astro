     <b>Tooling:</b> n8n, OpenAI, Gmail API<br/><br/>
I built a daily automation that pulls Substack newsletters from Gmail, ranks them by product-relevance, summarizes the key takeaways, and sends me a personalized recap — all before I finish my morning coffee. It uses a fine-tuned scoring logic to prioritize insights on product strategy, AI trends, and leadership. Original emails are then marked as read for inbox hygiene.<br/><br/>

<b>→ Why it matters:</b> Cuts through content overload, supports continuous learning, and turns passive reading into structured input.<br/>
<b>→ What it shows:</b> Prompt engineering, workflow design, GPT model integration, and email automation.



<b>Too much good content. Too little time.</b><br/><br/>

I used to keep tabs on ~10 Substack newsletters, all focused on product strategy, tech policy, and AI. But every week, I’d fall behind — and then forget what I’d read.<br/><br/>

So I built a system.<br/><br/>

<b>🎯 Objective</b><br/><br/>

To turn information overload into a structured daily insight loop — surfacing only what’s relevant to my work, without the inbox clutter.<br/><br/>

<b>🧠 What it does</b><br/><br/>
	•	Pulls newsletter emails via Gmail API<br/>
	•	Scores each based on product-relevance using prompt logic<br/>
	•	Summarizes key insights with GPT<br/>
	•	Sends me a daily digest<br/>
	•	Marks the original emails as read<br/>
