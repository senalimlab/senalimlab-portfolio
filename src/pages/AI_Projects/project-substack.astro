     <b>Tooling:</b> n8n, OpenAI, Gmail API<br/><br/>
I built a daily automation that pulls Substack newsletters from Gmail, ranks them by product-relevance, summarizes the key takeaways, and sends me a personalized recap — all before I finish my morning coffee. It uses a fine-tuned scoring logic to prioritize insights on product strategy, AI trends, and leadership. Original emails are then marked as read for inbox hygiene.<br/><br/>

<b>→ Why it matters:</b> Cuts through content overload, supports continuous learning, and turns passive reading into structured input.<br/>
<b>→ What it shows:</b> Prompt engineering, workflow design, GPT model integration, and email automation.
