This site started from a free GitHub template, but I rebuilt and customized much of it myself. When I got stuck, I turned to ChatGPT Codex to help troubleshoot and learn.<br/><br/>

These AI projects came from the same mindset:<br/>
<b>Use what’s available. Build what matters. Solve real friction.</b><br/><br/>

Each tool here came from a question I kept running into as a PM:<br/>
<b>“What am I doing repeatedly that doesn’t spark joy or impact?”</b><br/><br/>

The result: four lean, purposeful systems that quietly make my work faster, clearer, and more human.<br/><br/>
