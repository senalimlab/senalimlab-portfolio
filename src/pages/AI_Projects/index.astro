<p>
As a PM, I believe the best systems aren’t flash. They’re quiet, useful, and reliable in the background.<br/><br/>

Lately, I’ve been exploring AI not as hype, but as a tool to remove real-life frictions: information overload, scattered data, broken handoffs. I didn’t approach this like an engineer. I approached it like a PM.<br/><br/>

Each project started with one question:<br/>
<b>“What am I doing repeatedly that doesn’t spark joy, or impact?”</b><br/><br/>

The result? Four small, intentional tools that now quietly support how I work, learn, and collaborate.<br/>

    {aiProjects.map((item, i) => (
      <>
        <HorizontalCard {...item} />
        {i < aiProjects.length - 1 && <div class="divider my-0"></div>}
      </>
    ))}
  </section>
