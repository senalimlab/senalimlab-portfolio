<!-- Where I Come From -->

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Where I Come From</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      I grew up in Malaysia, where my family ran a small game console shop. As a kid, I was drawn to RPGs — not just for fun, but for the sense of progress, world-building, and discovery they offered.
      I later studied game programming in Singapore, where I discovered something magical: every bit of fantasy in games was powered by logic, structure, and iteration. That mindset has stayed with me.

<!-- What I Do Today -->

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What I Do Today</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      Today, I use product thinking to untangle ambiguity and build systems that quietly make life better.
      I work best in complex, cross-functional environments — aligning discovery with delivery, intuition with data, and vision with ground reality.
      Whether I’m launching new platforms or modernising old ones, I turn scattered inputs into clear direction, then experiment toward sustainable solutions.

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-700 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Calm in chaos:</strong> I bring structure and focus in ambiguous settings, setting momentum without creating noise.</li>
      <li><strong>Curious and hands-on:</strong> I dive into problems deeply — from ground-level user stories to platform-level decisions.</li>
      <li><strong>Respected and real:</strong> I’ve been told I lead with integrity, listen deeply, and earn trust across disciplines and cultures.</li>

      During my sabbatical, I’ve been experimenting with healthier baking — reimagining everyday treats as systems for emotional care and identity.
      I’m also building a portfolio of mission-aligned experiments across youth mental health, digital inclusion, ageing, and public safety.
